I am honored that my latest work on neuromorphic hardware-accelerated visual optical flow computation was featured in *Nature Communications* and subsequently interviewed and reported by several major media outlets, including China News Network, *Science*, and *The Economist*.

This research represents a significant advancement in neuromorphic computing, demonstrating how biologically-inspired hardware can achieve ultrafast visual perception capabilities that exceed human performance. The work showcases the potential of memristor-based systems for real-time motion prediction, object segmentation, and tracking in dynamic environments.

I am grateful to all my collaborators for their tremendous support and assistance, and especially to my corresponding professors for their guidance along the way. It is this support that has empowered me to do this work well. Please feel free to offer your criticism and suggestions.
