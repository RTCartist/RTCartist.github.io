I'm honored to have been awarded the Postgraduate Scholarship from the University of Hong Kong. This scholarship recognizes academic excellence and supports my continued research in neuromorphic computing and efficient AI systems.

This award will enable me to further pursue my research goals in developing biologically-inspired intelligent systems and advancing hardware-software co-design for next-generation AI acceleration.
