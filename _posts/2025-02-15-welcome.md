Welcome to my research portfolio! This site serves as a central hub for my work in neuromorphic computing and efficient AI systems.

## Research Focus

My current research spans several interconnected areas:

**RRAM-Based Computing**: I'm exploring how resistive random-access memory (RRAM) devices can be leveraged for efficient neural network acceleration. The unique analog computing properties of these devices enable new paradigms for in-memory computation.

**Bio-Inspired Navigation**: Drawing inspiration from the ring attractor networks found in biological systems like the Drosophila central complex, I'm developing efficient implementations for UAV SLAM applications.

**Efficient Transformers**: Large language models are incredibly powerful but computationally expensive. I'm working on techniques like linear attention mechanisms and extreme quantization to make these models more accessible.
