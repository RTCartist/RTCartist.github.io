Welcome to my research portfolio! This site serves as a central hub for my work in neuromorphic computing and efficient AI systems.

## Research Focus

My current research spans several interconnected areas:

**Efficient AI Algorithms & Architectures**: I'm developing neuromorphic optical flow methods that achieve 400% speedup over conventional approaches, with real-time processing capabilities (~1-2ms) for motion prediction, object segmentation, and tracking in dynamic environments like autonomous driving and robotics.

**Bio-inspired Neuromorphic Systems**: I'm implementing biologically-realistic perception mechanisms including high-order associative learning, differential sensory processing, and adaptive nociception for safe robotic grasping and navigation in unstructured environments with human-like capabilities.

**Simulation & Modeling Resources for Emerging Memory**: I'm creating general memristive transistor models (GEM) with 300% improvement in switching accuracy, real-time state modulation circuits, and comprehensive SPICE implementations for neuromorphic hardware design and validation across different device types and scales.
