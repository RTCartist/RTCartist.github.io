I'm thrilled to have been selected as a recipient of the Cambridge International Scholarship, one of only 80 awardees worldwide. This prestigious scholarship recognizes outstanding academic achievement and research potential.

Unfortunately, due to the refusal of ATAS (Academic Technology Approval Scheme), I was unable to attend Cambridge for my PhD studies. However, this recognition has been a significant milestone in my academic journey and has motivated me to continue pursuing excellence in my research.
